Remember:
* The default Django server is not fit for production. Got to use a production server.
* Default server automatically reloads for code changes, but not for file adds (restart needed).
* To create templates for an app, a 'templates' folder has to be created in the app folder.
* The {% static %} template tag is not available for use in static files which arenâ€™t generated by Django, like your stylesheet. You should always use relative paths to link your static files between each other, because then you can change STATIC_URL (used by the static template tag to generate its URLs) without having to modify a bunch of paths in your static files as well.


Commands:
* Create project: 
    django-admin startproject projectName
* Start default server: 
    python manage.py runserver
* Create an app: 
    python manage.py startapp appName
* Getting a Django shell with the path to siteName/settings.py automatically included:
    python manage.py shell
* For enabling database migrations for an app, it first
    has to be recognized in settings.py. Make an entry in 
    INSTALLED_APPS and then run python manage.py makemigrations appName
* Making model changes is a 3 stage process:
    1. Change models in model.py
    2. Run python manage.py makemigrations
    3. Run python manage.py migrate
* Creating an admin user: 
    python manage.py createsuperuser    
* For the app's models to be accessible in the admin interface:
    in appName/admin.py, type:
    from .models import Question
    admin.site.register(Question)  
* To run test cases for an app:
    python manage.py test appName 
    
URL finding:
Settings.py has URLCONF -> points to siteName.urls.py -> points to appName.urls.py
